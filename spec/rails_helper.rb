  # RSpec Rails can automatically mix in different behaviours to your tests

  #
  # You can disable this behaviour by removing the line below, and instead
  # explicitly tag your specs with their type, e.g.:
  #
  #     RSpec.describe UsersController, :type => :controller do
  #       # ...
  #     end

  # The different available types are documented in the features, such as in
  # https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-rails/docs
